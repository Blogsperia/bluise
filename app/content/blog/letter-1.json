  "content": "My Dearest Palak,\n\nThere's something incredibly therapeutic about pouring one's heart out, right? Especially to the one for whom these unexpressed words are intended. It’s like unburdening the soul, letting emotions flow freely, and finding solace in the act of expression.\n\nI loved you and for a long time, I never expressed my feelings for you. Of course, I had told you once that I loved you. But it’s never just that, right? There’s a plethora of feelings and actions, memories and dreams, associated with these three words, which I never got to communicate to you. And it bothered me for a long, long time. 13 years. Nothing hurts more than unsaid words.\n\nAnd I am really glad that now, I get to share these things with you. It feels as if in my otherwise chaotic life, I've discovered a secret doorway to a place of peace within you. It's a sanctuary where every emotion, every sentiment, and every raw feeling has a voice…\n\nIn our conversation the other day, I truly meant it when I said that sending these letters makes me feel better and sane. And the unspoken understanding that radiated from your response – 'I know, I understand' - meant the world to me. Those four words felt like a comforting embrace for my soul.\n\nYour understanding is a lifeline in a world that feels chaotic and unpredictable. It's a reminder that even in the vastness of existence, there are those rare connections where words don't need to be dissected or analyzed – they just need to be felt.\n\nIt's not just about the letters; it's about the empathy that you extend, creating a safe space for vulnerability. It's a treasure beyond measure.\n\nHaving said that, you are not obligated to read or response to these letters. In fact, if you ever feel uncomfortable, just say it and I will stop sending you these letters.\n\nHereafter, I will post all my letters here. However, I am not going to share this website with you now… I will send only some of them to you directly. Because some of these letters might really make you feel uncomfortable. And I don’t want to piss you off…\n\nAnyway, thank you, truly and deeply. In your understanding, I find solace, and in your understanding, I find home.\n\nWith love, hugs and other things,\nPritam",
