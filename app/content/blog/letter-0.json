If there was an exam on the day, I'd wish you in person at school. If not, I'd ring you up. On that landline. And guess who always answered? Yep, your mom! Always. You never picked up the phone. Classic move on my part was to hang up every time. Sorry about that. I was genuinely scared‚Ä¶\n\nThen came the era of cellphones. I still had your number when you moved to Silchar after high school and would text you on your birthday. But once you moved to Pune, we lost touch.\n\nI would miss you, especially on this day. Sometimes, I would ping you on Facebook and you would respond, although mostly monosyllabic. It took me quite a while to understand that sometimes, you might love someone who isn‚Äôt meant to stay in your life and it‚Äôs alright.

And whatever demon is bothering you, I am sure you will conquer them someday and wear your scars like wings.\n\nHere's to you! You are magic‚ú® Happy birthday! ü•≥ ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nWith love hugs and other things,\nP",
