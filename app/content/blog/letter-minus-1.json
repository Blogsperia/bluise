  "content": "Dearest Palak,\n\nThis is what happened while I was at home.\n\nOne day, I noticed there were two bikes in the garage. So, I asked dad if the older one still worked.\n\n'Takes time to start off. But yeah, it works,' he replied.\n\n'Why donâ€™t you sell it now that you got a new one?'\n\nHe thought for a moment, as if hesitating, before answering, 'Your mother got me that oneâ€¦'\n\nI couldnâ€™t help but smile.\n\nI came back to my room. My old table has a drawer where I used to keep my â€˜precious thingsâ€™ back in my school days. I felt like going through it.\n\nIn an era when we need Facebook to trigger our memories, it was amazing how a certain conversation with my dad brought back so much of the buried past.\n\nRummaging through the drawer, I realized it wasnâ€™t touched at all in all these years. Even I didnâ€™t bother to open it when I returned home. Untouched memories from more than a decade back.\n\nAmong other things, I found a small box and I opened it. There were folded pieces of paper - pages torn from my school notebooks where you had written my name or anything else, maybe those FLAMES thingy - basically, your handwriting.\n\nI remembered how after high school, I sat one day and went through all my notebooks to find where you had left your handwriting. I had torn those pages carefully and saved them in this box.\n\nLittle did I know that those scribbles would become cherished memorabilia. Perhaps, I inherited this sentiment from my dad. Our items may vary, but the essence of saving them remains.\n\nAs I closed the drawer, I couldn't shake the realization that sometimes, the most precious memories are tucked away in the simplest of places. And so, both the old bike and the pieces of paper continue to tell storiesâ€”each a silent narrator of the chapters of our lives.\n\nWith love hugs and other things,\nP",
